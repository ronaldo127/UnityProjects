# UnityMyProjects

These are projects that I have created to learn the main features of Unity3D. They are experiments, but they show concepts that I have learned. Moreover, I'm studying some concepts of game design, so I intent to apply some of those in each project when I have enough time.

##Projects that I will give extra attention and manage a TODO list

###BlockBreaker
https://github.com/ronaldo127/UnityProjects/tree/master/BlockBreaker

This is an Arkanoid like game. I have used particles, some vector math and 2D physics

###GlitchGarden
https://github.com/ronaldo127/UnityProjects/tree/master/GlitchGarden

This is a Plants vs Zombies like gameplay. I have use lots of animations, which are based on sprites and 2D skeletal animation, iteration on play-testing and UI system for multi-screen resolution.

##The other I will give extra attention as soon as I can, but I want to publish those 2 first.
number-wizard-ui is a prediction number game which uses random binary-search as prediction method.

Text101 is a game based on story that uses machine of states.

Laser Defender is a space shooter 2D

Bowlmaster is a bowling game that I have implemented its score counting by using TDD concepts.
